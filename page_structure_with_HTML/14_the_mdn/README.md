# The best HTML resource: MDN

The **M**ozilla **D**eveloper **N**etwork (or MDN) is a fantastic resource for learning more about HTML and CSS. It contains up-to-date, comprehensive examples and descriptions of HTML elements and CSS properties.

Throughout your web development journey, you should use MDN often!

I know that when you're learning a new language it can be tricky to know _where_ to find correct, updated knowledge, so that's why you should know about the MDN!

Whenever you struggle with something, or can't remember something about HTML and CSS, you'll likely go on a search engine to find more about it.

Although there are many websites and blogs that talk about almost any topic you can think of, you can treat the MDN as _almost_ a source of truth. Remember though, that it's written by people&mdash;so it can still contain errors or inconsistencies!

Here's the HTML reference: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). Here, you can find any HTML element and read up more on it, what it's used for, what parents it can have, and a lot more.

## Conclusion

With this, we're done with the HTML section! You're now ready to tackle the incredible world of CSS.

Let's do it!
